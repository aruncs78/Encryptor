# 📊 Streamlit CSV Visualizer & App Encryptor V2.0

Welcome to the **streamlined data visualization and application protection suite**. This project serves two distinct purposes:
1.  **Data Visualization**: An interactive tool to upload and visualize CSV data sets.
2.  **Application Encryption**: A robust utility to encrypt multiple Python files into a single, self-contained, protected script with in-memory import capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📈 Component 1: CSV Data Visualizer (`app.py`)

This is the core application for data analysis. It allows users to upload CSV files and instantly generate insights.

### Features
*   **Automatic Data Detection**: Identifies numeric and categorical columns.
*   **Interactive Charts**: 
    *   **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between two numeric variables.
    *   **Histograms**: Analyse the distribution of a single numeric variable.
    *   **Bar Charts**: Compare categorical data against numeric values/counts.

### How to Run
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
*   Once running, open the URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
*   Upload any `.csv` file to start visualizing.

## 🔒 Component 2: Streamlit App Encryptor (`encryptor.py`)

**New in v2.0:** The encryptor now supports **multi-file projects** and handles **internal imports** flawlessly.

This tool creates a **Single Executable Bundle** from your Streamlit application code. It encrypts all your source files, bundles them together, and includes a smart loader that can import modules directly from the encrypted memory bundle without ever writing them to disk.

### Features
*   **Multi-File Support**: Upload your main script (e.g., `app.py`) and all helper modules (e.g., `utils.py`, `database.py`).
*   **Smart Bundling**: All files are encrypted and packed into one output file (`protected_app.py`).
*   **In-Memory Imports**: Includes a custom `EncryptedImporter` hook (using `sys.meta_path`). This allows your protected code to `import utils` seamlessly, even though `utils.py` does not exist on the file system.
*   **Zero-Trace Execution**: Decrypted code lives only in memory during execution.

### How to Use
1.  **Start the Encryptor Service**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run encryptor.py
    ```
2.  **Upload Your Apps**:
    *   In the web interface, use the file uploader to select **ALL** the Python files that make up your application (main script + all local dependencies).
3.  **Select Entry Point**:
    *   Use the dropdown menu to select which file should be run as the main entry point (e.g., `app.py`).
4.  **Encrypt**:
    *   Click the **"Encrypt & Generate Protected App"** button.
5.  **Download**:
    *   Download the generated `protected_app.py`.

## 🛡️ Component 3: Running Protected Apps

The output from the Encryptor is a standalone Streamlit application. It contains all the uploaded modules.

### How to Run
```bash
streamlit run protected_app.py
```

### Technical Details (v2.0)
*   **Bundling**: The script contains a dictionary mapping module names to their encrypted byte content.
*   **Execution**: When run, the script installs a custom `MetaPathFinder` into `sys.meta_path`.
*   **Import Resolution**: When the code does `import helper`, the custom finder traps the call, decrypts the bytecode for `helper` from the bundle, and executes it in a new module object. This completely bypasses the file system.
*   **Security Disclaimer**: The key is embedded in the script to allow it to run standalone. This provides **obfuscation** and prevents casual modifications/inspection. It protects your intellectual property from easy copy-pasting but is not a replacement for DRM.
